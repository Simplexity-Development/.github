# Simplexity Development Code of Conduct

## Introduction

Welcome to Simplexity Development! We're glad you're here. As an open source community, we value diversity, inclusivity, and respect. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for behavior when contributing to our projects, making issues, submitting requests, as well as getting and giving support. Our goal is to maintain a positive and constructive environment for everyone involved. By contributing to Simplexity Development's projects, you agree to follow this code of conduct.

## Where this applies

This code of conduct applies in all Simplexity Development community spaces and interaction. This includes the GitHub, Discord, as well as anywhere that the projects are being posted or advertised.

## Interaction Guidelines

We welcome contributions from anyone, regardless of background, experience, or identity. Here are some guidelines for keeping communication running smoothly:

- **Treat Others with Respect:** Be considerate and respectful in your interactions. Disagreements are normal, but avoid personal attacks, insults, and derogatory language.

- **Value Diverse Perspectives:** Embrace and respect different viewpoints and experiences. Diversity contributes to a richer and more innovative community. 

- **Provide Constructive Feedback:** When offering feedback, focus on the content and ideas rather than the individual. Provide suggestions for improvement in a positive and helpful way.

- **Provide An English Translation Along With Any Non-English Text:** The moderators of this organization are only fluent in English, we need English to be able to moderate properly. It would also be helpful if you mention that you are using a translator so that we are able to keep that in mind, as translators sometimes confuse terms. Mentioning you are using a translator is not required, however.


## Unethical use of code

Simplexity Development highly values the ethical use of our code and technology. By contributing to or using our project, you agree to the following:

- **No Malicious Intent:** You may not use the code or any derived work from this project for malicious, harmful, or illegal purposes.

- **Responsible Use:** If you fork or otherwise use our code, you are responsible for its ethical and responsible use. Do not engage in activities that could harm individuals, organizations, or society as a whole.

- **Open Source Principles:** If you fork or use our code, you are encouraged to adhere to the principles of open source software, including contributing back improvements and changes to the community.
