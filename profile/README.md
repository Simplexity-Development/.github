# Simplexity Development

Hullo! We are Simplexity, a small dev team that makes stuff 'cause it's fun.

## What We Make

Our projects fall into a few broad categories:

### Minecraft Plugins

Most of our plugins are plugins that kinda 'Do one thing' - this is because we were annoyed with having an entire server's functionality broken by a single plugin being non-functional or not updated. Some of these projects are:

- **[SimpleNicks](https://github.com/Simplexity-Development/SimpleNicks)** - Nickname plugin that supports MiniMessage and allows you to save nickname presets
- **[SimplePMs](https://github.com/Simplexity-Development/SimplePMs)** - Easy private messaging, with social spy
- **[SimplePrefixes](https://github.com/Simplexity-Development/SimplePrefixes)** - Player selectable customizable prefixes.
- **[SimpleChat](https://github.com/Simplexity-Development/SimpleChat)** - Simple customizable permission-based chat formatting
- **[VillagerInfo](https://github.com/Simplexity-Development/VillagerInfo)** - Shows the info about Villagers that is usually hidden behind the `/data get` command
- **[Scythe](https://github.com/Simplexity-Development/Scythe)** - Allows right-click harvest and auto-replant
- **[InvisibleFrames](https://github.com/Simplexity-Development/InvisibleFrames)** - Allows easy toggling of item frames to be invisible

## What We Care About

### Open Source First

Everything we can open-source, we do. The suggestions and contributions from other people have made our projects far better, and we value that a lot.

### Simple to Use

When creating a project, our goals are to make it easy to use, configure, and manage on the user-end. This can take quite a lot of additional planning and testing.

### Respect, Patience, and Good Vibes

Our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Simplexity-Development/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) is built around being decent to each other.
We don't tolerate harassment, bigotry, or starting drama
